# React animation

### Description
This is a demo to demonstrate an approach how you can cope with animations in react.

Requirements:
* Javascript has to be used for animating.
* Animation has to be handled by HOC, not by a component it self.

Used libraries:
* anime.js [http://animejs.com](http://animejs.com)
* ReactTransitionGroup [https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group)

Drawbacks:
* animated component has to be a class in order to get a reference to it.
